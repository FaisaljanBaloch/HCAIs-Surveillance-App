# HCAI App

The HCAI Application will serve as a mechanism to monitor and report HCAIs across hospitals in Pakistan. The surveillance application will allow healthcare professionals to identify, track and report patients with infections to their respective organizations and other concerned parties. It will enable them to monitor the HCAIs caused while under care in the healthcare facility.

Healthcare practitioners (doctors, nurses, hospital administration) can download the HCAI Application on their mobile devices. It has the capacity to store data related to large numbers of patients. Coupled with a dashboard, the app enables doctors and nurses to insert patient data and generate trends based upon a selected set of variables. Patients have unique ID numbers through which the information can be stored and viewed. The app has a selection of pre-loaded infections that healthcare professionals merely need to select when collecting patient data. This makes the process highly efficient. Reminders from the app allow healthcare practitioners to double check whether a patient is infected or not.
